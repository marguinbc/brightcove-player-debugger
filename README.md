# brightcove-player-debugger

brightcove-player-debugger is a plugin for the Brightcove Player that will log, capture and display various information about the player, media and advertising in use. With this plugin, you can observe:

## Example:
http://solutions.brightcove.com/marguin/debugger/index.html

## Features:

 - Attaches itself to a Brightcove Player by using the video element’s ID attribute
 - Can be minimized to reduce impact when testing players in the wild
 - Listens for player events using player.on() and logs them to the Log div.
 - Captures the browser’s debug console log entries and adds them to itself.
 - Records media info for the current video loaded in the player
 - Records IMA3 ad settings when IMA plugin is used
 - Records Freewheel ad settings when FW plugin is used
 - Records the current Ad information when an ad is playing (pause the player to make sure you can view the info in the Ad Settings Tab)
 - Captures and displays the current ‘player state’ using the CSS classes that are attached to the player
 - Can toggle player state by clicking on the class name and adding/removing classes from the player
 - Can toggle the display of the Log, Classes, Player Settings, Ad Settings

### Conveniently Show/Hide the debugger
The debugger will attach itself below the first player on the page. Using the Show/Hide debugger button it can be colapsed to take up just enough space for the Show Debugger button.  

You can also toggle the visibility for any of the four debugger panes: Player Classes, Ad Setting, Player Settings and the Log.

The log includes filters to show/hide the following types of events:
 - Player events - events associated with the player’s activity
